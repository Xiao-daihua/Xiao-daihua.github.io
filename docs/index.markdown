Hi! I’m **Yu Liu** — currently a master’s student in Physics at EPFL, and a graduate of Tsinghua University. I'm interested in quantum gravity, especially the AdS/CFT correspondence and related theoretical physics topics.



## Physics Pages
Here are some of my physics-related pages:
- [Notes](/note.markdown): A collection of my study notes on various physics topics as well as lecture notes from courses I've taken.
- [Papers Database](/database.markdown): A database of research papers on various topics that I find interesting. 


##  Beyond Physics
Outside the lab, I’m a **Broadway musical** enthusiast and I love **skiing**. Feel free to explore:
-  [Musicals](/musical.markdown) blog: This is a blog where I share my understandings and reviews of various Broadway musicals (while mostly broadway ones). Unfortunately, it's currently only available in Chinese.
