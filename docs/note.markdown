Hi there! Welcome to my notes page!

Here I will share most of my course notes from my master’s studies at EPFL. I also plan to post notes on a variety of topics in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics. 

I firmly believe that the best way to truly understand something is to write it down independently, so I aim to create a learning note for almost every topic I study.
Of course, mistakes and disorganization are inevitable—some notes were written when I was first encountering a topic and didn’t yet have a full grasp of it (I'll mark then out by calling "initial notes"). Nonetheless, they reflect my learning process and are no less valuable for that reason.

The source code of all notes are hosted on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Xiao-daihua). Btw the template for the notes are also open sourced [here](https://github.com/Xiao-daihua/Reading_Latextemplate)

I plan to post all notes in English in the future, although some earlier notes are written in Chinese (apologies for that).

# Lecture Notes

Here are the lecture notes I took during my master’s studies at EPFL.
### 2025 Fall Semester

- [Quantum Field Theory 1](https://github.com/Xiao-daihua/EPFL_course/raw/main/QFT_1_course/main.pdf) (in Chinese)
- [General Relativity and Cosmology 1](https://github.com/Xiao-daihua/EPFL_course/raw/main/GR_1_course/main.pdf)    (in Chinese)
- [Quantum Mechanics 3](https://github.com/Xiao-daihua/EPFL_course/raw/main/QM_3_course/main.pdf)  (in Chinese)
- [Quantum Information Theory](https://github.com/Xiao-daihua/EPFL_course/raw/main/QI_course/main.pdf) (in Chinese)


# Learning Notes

These are the learning notes I compiled while exploring a range of topics in theoretical physics and mathematics. They reflect my ongoing study, insights, and attempts to understand complex concepts across these fields.

## Mathematics



## Basic QFT




## CFT

- [Initial Notes on 2D CFT](https://github.com/Xiao-daihua/Phys_Learning/raw/main/CFT_note_1/CFT.pdf) (in Chinese) This is an initial learning note which is poorly organized, it mainly follows the idea of Polchinski's book and Ribault's lecture notes. I will rewrite a better organized note in the future.
- [Fundamentals of 2D CFT](https://github.com/Xiao-daihua/Phys_Learning/raw/main/Minimal_CFT/main.pdf) This is a better organized note on 2D CFT, mainly following the idea of Di Francesco's book. It provides a minimal introduction to 2D CFT.
- [Initial Notes on BCFT](https://github.com/Xiao-daihua/Phys_Learning/raw/main/Primary_BCFT/main.pdf) This is my initial study note on Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT).

## 3D Gravity
