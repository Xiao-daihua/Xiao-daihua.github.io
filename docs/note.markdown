# Welcome to my note page!
Hi there! Welcome to my notes page!

Here I will share most of my course notes from my master’s studies at EPFL. I also plan to post notes on a variety of topics in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics. 

I firmly believe that the best way to truly understand something is to write it down independently, so I aim to create a learning note for almost every topic I study.
Of course, mistakes and disorganization are inevitable—some notes were written when I was first encountering a topic and didn’t yet have a full grasp of it (I'll mark then out by calling "initial notes"). Nonetheless, they reflect my learning process and are no less valuable for that reason.

The source code of all notes are hosted on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Xiao-daihua). Btw the template for the notes are also open sourced [here](https://github.com/Xiao-daihua/Reading_Latextemplate)

I plan to post all notes in English in the future, although some earlier notes are written in Chinese (apologies for that).
