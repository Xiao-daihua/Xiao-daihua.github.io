# 2+1 Dimensional Gravity Fundamentals

To gain more insights on 3+1 quantum gravity, we often study lower-dimensional models as they can be more tractable while still capturing essential features of gravity. 
One such model is 2+1 dimensional gravity, which has been extensively studied in the context of both classical and quantum gravity.

- Classical 2+1 Dim Gravity
    - In Witten's work [Witten1988](/papers/1988-12witten), it was shown that 2+1 dimensional gravity with can be formulated as a Chern-Simons theory.
