title: 2+1 Dimentional Gravity
tags: [3D Gravity]

It has beenm a long time since people starts to work on quantizing gravitational field. And lower dimensional gravity provides us a good playground to test various ideas and methods. 

In particular, 2+1 dimensional gravity has been studied extensively since it is much simpler than the physical 3+1 dimensional case, yet still shares many important features.



### Chern-Simons Formulation

It has been revealed that the 2+1 dimensional gravity can be reformulated as a Chern-Simons gauge theory:
- [1988-12witten](/papers/1988-12witten/) One of the first attempts to reformulate 2+1 dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory and quantize it.

### Classical Phase Space

It is commonly used to study the 2+1 dimensional gravity using a constriant first quantization. Thus, it is important to understand the classical phase space of the theory. 

Though having a Action identical to Chern-Simons theory, the phase space of 2+1 dimensional gravity is quite different from a usual Chern-Simons theory, which turns out to be:
$$
\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{T}
$$
or equivalently
$$
\mathcal{M} = T^* \mathcal{T}
$$

Several papers give detailed discussions on this topic:
