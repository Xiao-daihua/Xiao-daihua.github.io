# Welcome to Jekyll!

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

now test some math:
$$E = mc^2$$

Then I want some math that is not inline perhaps

$$\int_a^b f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)$$

This is so cool! Then I want to label a formula

$$
    e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$
This is awsome!!! I can write it with a auto preview that follows my writing!!!

$$
    \frac{d}{dx}e^{x} = e^{x}
$$

# This is a first level header

I will talk about some details in physics, In physics we have:

## Second level header

I then want to write some awsome 物理公式！！

## Third level header


This is even better than LaTeX!!! I love this writing flow!!!
